# Introduction to Computers and Programming

* Program: set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a task
    * Commonly referred to as Software
* Programmer: person who can design, create, and test computer programs
    * Also known as software developer
* Hardware: The physical devices that make up a computer
* Input device: component that collects the data
* Digital: describes any device that stores data as binary numbers


## Software :
* Application software: programs that make computer useful for every day tasks
* System software: programs that control and manage basic operations of a computer
  - Operating system: controls operations of hardware components
  - Utility Program: performs specific task to enhance computer operation or safeguard data
  - Software development tools: used to create, modify, and test software programs

## Compilers and Interpreters
Programs written in high-level languages must be translated into machine language to be executed
* Compiler: translates high-level language program into separate machine language program
* Interpreter: translates and executes instructions in high-level language program
  - Used by Python language
  - Interprets one instruction at a time
  - No separate machine language program

## Language 
* Machine language program can be executed at any time
  * Assembly language: uses short words (mnemonics) for instructions instead of binary numbers
  * Assembler: translates assembly language to machine language for execution by CPU
* Low-level language: close in nature to machine language (assembly language)
* High-Level language: allows simple creation of powerful and complex programs

## Python interpreter can be used in two modes:
* Interactive mode: enter statements on keyboard
* Script mode: save statements in Python script

## Key Words, Operators, and Syntax
* Key words: predefined words used to write program in high-level language, Each key word has specific meaning
* Operators: perform operations on data
  - Example: math operators to perform arithmetic
* Syntax: set of rules to be followed when writing program
* Statement: individual instruction used in high-level language
* Source code: statements written by programmer
* Syntax error: prevents code from being translated
